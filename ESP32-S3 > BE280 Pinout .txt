ESP32-S2 → BME280 Pin Out

VIN → Power input (3.3–5 V, has regulator onboard)

3Vo → 3.3 V output from the regulator (ignore this, only needed if you power from VIN >3.3 V)

GND → Ground

SCK → Clock line → used as SCL in I²C, or SCK in SPI

SDI → Data in/out → used as SDA in I²C, or MOSI in SPI

SDO → Data out / address select (I²C address or MISO in SPI)

CS → Chip Select (must be tied HIGH for I²C mode)

| -------------- | ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| VIN            | 3.3 V            |                        								   |
| GND            | GND              | Common ground                                            |
| SCK            | SCL              | (use the pin labeled **SCL** on your board)              |
| SDI            | SDA              | (use the pin labeled **SDA** on your board)              |
| SDO            | GND              | Sets address to `0x76` (tie to 3.3 V if you want `0x77`) |
| CS             | 3.3 V            | Tie HIGH to enable I²C mode                              |
